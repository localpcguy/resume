##Scss

This folder should contain all of the Sass files for the site.  They are broken down as follows:

    |-scss - root folder, would only include non underscored sass files, that would output css files
        |-base - global styles, icons, reset/normalize. "Global" is files for things like: buttons, layout helpers, vendor style overrides (if applicable), typography
        |-pages - styles for individual templates
        |-partials - this would be specifically for any Sass files that donâ€™t actually output any CSS
        |-modules - modular pieces of css. Things like: header, footer, login panel, etc
        |-vendors - anything from an external plugin or framework
