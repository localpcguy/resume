#Resume Manager

This is an app for managing, displaying or generating a resume from a JSON data file.

###Files that should not be source controlled:

 - `/node_modules` - for Node dependencies and build tools
 - `/bower_components` - if using bower for client packages
 - `/dst` - the compiled version will likely not be source controlled unless using source control for deployment

###Installation:

 - `npm install` to install the gulp packages via the `package.json` file
